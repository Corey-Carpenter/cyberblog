# Corey Cyber Security Blog

## A blog page created by me to showcase my interest in certain cyber security topics. Used with Azure Labs and a godaddy website to make my own secure web application. However godaddy is resetting all the html, css, and js added every hour and there's nothing I can do to fix that so I'm putting my website on github for my teacher to be able to actually see what I created.
